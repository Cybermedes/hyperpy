# Hyperpy

A repository containing my solutions for some exercise projects available
on the website Hyperskill (https://hyperskill.org/).

To keep the projects organized, each project is in a dedicated folder (not package).
To run one just go the directory (list down below with Hyperskill url links for more info)
and run
```shell
python3 main.py
```
